# Water drinking reminder
Remind yourself to take enough water!

## Motivation
I wanted to take a look at Tauri, as it's a new way of developing cross-platform desktop applications based on tools we're familiar with, like React. One thing I tend to forget during workdays is drinking enough water. This simple app should solve my problem.

## Features
- Set drinking goal
- Set a time interval for drink breaks
- Windowed warnings to take a drink

## Yet to implement
- Notifications using native notification system

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

## Memory usage
The most extreme I've seen is probably ~200 mb (open). On a normal day it's around 80 mb when sitting in the tray icon.
